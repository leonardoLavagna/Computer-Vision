# Computer Vision
Here you can find some computer vision experiments using the python library cv2, some matrix completion techniques and others. In particular:
- An **image blurer** used to blur car's plates 
- A **face detection** system
- An **image reconstruction** method based on [Matrix Completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_completion) (Alternating Least Square method)
- A complete **image classification system** based on [filters, convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)), and [color histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_histogram).

The images, auxiliary functions and other material needed for the execution of the programs can be found in the appropriate folders.
