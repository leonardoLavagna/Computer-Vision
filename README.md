In this repository we develop some computer vision techniques, in particular:
- a **simple image recognition system** based on image filering and color histograms (the files needed to execute the notebook can be found in the files branch of this repository)
- A **bluer image** used to blur car's plates (the files needed to execute the notebook can be found in the files branch of this repository)
- A **face detection** system

**Remark .** This project startedwith the Fundamentals of Data Science's course held By Prof. Fabio Galasso @ Sapienza with the simple image recognition system, Then I added two more features (the image blier system and the face detection system). To the simple image recognition system contributed Edoardo Loru and Alessia Sgrigna.
