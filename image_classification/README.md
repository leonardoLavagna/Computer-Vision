We will carry out an image identification task based on filters, convolution, and color histograms.


### What's in here?
Here you can find:
- The notebook of the project `image_classification.ipynb`
- The files needed for the image classification task and the dataset we used (text files and zip folders)

### Dataset
All the images we used for the classification task are in the zipped folders `model.zip` and `query.zip`. This last zipped folders contains some query images and on these the classification task has been carried out.

### Disclamair
This project was part of a course of Foundamentals of Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome held by Prof. F. Galasso. This project was done in collaboration with Edoardo Loru and Alessia Sgrigna.
